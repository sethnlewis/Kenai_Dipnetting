# Kenai Dipnetting
I'm predicting when I should go fishing (dipnetting) in Kenai, Alaska. It's real data in a real situation. Data science is providing me with actionable findings, not just another useless data science "project" you've seen a hundred times. The stakes are high: a year's worth of salmon in my freezer.

Note that this isn't cleaned or commented as a professional work sample. Look at other repositories if you want that. Look here if you want to see:
1. The date exact date I plan to go dipnetting based on predictive time series analysis using Prophet.
2. Proof that peak salmon migration is slowly becoming later and later. This is speculated to be caused by climate change. Also, some models are worthless here. Simple regression proves to be the best demonstration of these trends (though I admittedly didn't spend time tuning hyperparameters, which I'll save that for when you give me a job). I would be curious to see how Prophet (used elsewhere in the file) predicts this changing. Maybe I'll do that when I get back from fishing.
3. Salmon migration data from 1979 through 2025.
