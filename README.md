# Kenai_Dipnetting
I'm predicting when I should go fishing (dipnetting) in Kenai, Alaska. It's real data in a real situation. Data science providing me with actionable findings. The stakes are high: a year's worth of salmon in my freezer.

Note that this isn't cleaned or commented as a professional work sample. Look at other repositories if you want that. Look here if you want to see:
1. Fish migration data from 1979 through 2025.
2. The date exact date I plan to go [dipnetting]([url](https://alaskaoutdoorssupersite.com/dipnetting-the-kenai)) based on predictive time series analysis.
3. Proof that peak salmon migration is slowly becoming later and later. This is speculated to be caused by climate change. Also, some models are worthless here. Simple regression proves to be the best demonstration of these trends (though I admittedly didn't spend time tuning hyperparameters, which I'll save that for when you give me a job). I would be curious to see how Prophet (used elsewhere in the file) predicts this changing. Maybe I'll do that when I get back from fishing.
